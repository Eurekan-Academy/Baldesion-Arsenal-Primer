## What is BA?

The Baldesion Arsenal is the final raid zone inside Hydatos, and has some special rules (i.e. you cannot resurrect people except for using special actions). You will need Elemental Level 60 to enter and have the main Eureka questline completed.

This guide is intended for players who are new to BA, so it will not aim to explain *everything*. Things like chaining Double Edge, reflecting the Earth room or even how to use Death L are beyond the scope of this page. Buf if you want to learn more, and enjoyed your first run, do check out the links towards the end, and the two discords have a ton of advanced resources too to help you continue to learn and become a BA veteran.

The quickest way to check if you are ready to join BA, is if you see no blue lines going towards the building at the horizon, and if the `Expedition Scholar` at (21.1, 13.8) in Hydatos is willing to sell you an `Aetheric Stabilizer` (DON'T buy one, this is just to test).
If this is not the case then you will need to check where you are with your quests and complete them.

### Hydatos questline

- Level 50: Talk to Krile and then, after a cutscene, to Gerolt. After another cutscene, speak again with Krile.
- Level 51: Talk to Krile. Head to The Central Columns at 20.3-24.8 and talk again to Krile. Head south to The Val River Source 25.7-30.7 to find the Pooled Aether. Return to the The Central Columns and speak to Krile.
- Level 54: Talk to Krile. Head to The Western Columns at 10.6-29.6 and talk to Krile again. Head to The West Val River Bank 6.5-15.7 to find the Pooled Aether after walking up the large column. Return to The Western Columns at 10.6-29.6 and talk to Krile.
- Level 57: Talk to Krile at the The Western Columns at 10.6-29.6. Then head east to The Eastern Columns at 31.3-27.2 and talk to Krile again. Head north to The East Val River Bank at 30.8-14.4 to find the Pooled Aether. Return to The Eastern Columns at 31.3-27.2 and talk to Krile.
- Level 60: Talk to Krile at the The Eastern Columns at 31.3-27.2. Head to The Aetherbridge Foundation at 24.0-30.6 and talk again to Krile. Head into the Headquarters Entrance and talk to Krile, then talk to her again in the Board Room. Interact with the Scattered Tomes and talk again to Krile for a few lengthy cutscenes. Choose between Krile's path (sealing) or that of Ejika Tsunjika (destruction) for another cutscene. Return to Central Point and talk to Ejika Tsunjika (when doing Krile's path) or Krile (when doing Ejika's path) to complete the quest.
- Speak with the Expedition Scholar to unlock BA

## How do I join?

For all runs, we are using Discord for voice chat (you don't have to speak, but at least be able to listen). On the Light datacentre, please join 
- [Eurekan Academy](https://discord.gg/eurekanacademy) 
- [Light Forays Group](https://discord.gg/LightForays)

and take a look at the `#assign-role` / `#role-selection` channels so you are able to join us in voice.

The Schedule for both servers can be found ![here](https://bit.ly/BAruns) and runs are also announced in their channels too.

A typical run takes about 2 hours. Not all the time is spent fighting, but if we have new players joining, we spend time on explanations too. And sometimes, Ovni spawn can delay the actual start too - more on that later.

There are several types of BA runs
- Impromptu Runs: These are without sign-up in advance. The code to enter the Party Finder groups will be posted shortly before the run, and all spots are FFA and they're newbie-friendly
- Frag Runs: Similar to an Impromptu, but they typically stop before AV and don't go all the way to the end of BA. Good for getting those fragments as they're pretty quick!
- Organised Runs (Newbie/Reclear): These are with signups in advanced and have a fixed roster. Sometimes there are free spots for late joiners, but usually they are filled well in advance
- Challenge runs / Meme runs / Reflex runs / Mechanic runs / Squad runs: Special rules apply on these. Maybe better left for when you are more experienced, as a lot of these are without explanations

## How do I prepare?

You will need Logograms.
It is important that everone has a Spirit of the remembered, and basic dps logograms for their role.

Below are the recommended actions for players who are new to BA. There are more advanced actions you could use, but we'll get to that at the end of this guide, and it is fine if you stick to the basic actions for now.

For equipment, just use your best gear for the job, it will scale down.
Later on, once you got more fragments, you can upgrade your weapon to a `Physeos` version and use `elemental +2` gear to have even better stats.

For your chest slot, you should use:
- Tanks and DPS - [Kirin's Osode of xxx](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/090fb17ff58/)
- Healers and Casters - [Vermilion Cloak of xxx](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/item/0704efd723d/)

That chestpiece is still best in slot for doing BA and benefits from melding too.

### Umbral/Astral slots

You will need to know how to craft in both Umbral/Astral slots to make best use of your Logos action slots. Here is how:

## What do we do before we go into BA?

To enter the Arsenal, you need a special buff that is available from either the Ovni fate, or Tristitia. It will allow you to enter the portals. To get the buff, you need to have BA unlocked, and be level 60, and get a gold rating from the fate.
So it is important that you do get a hit in and do some damage to it, otherwise you may not be able to enter BA at all.

![](img/ovni.png)

For most players in the raid, we enter after the Ovni fate. There often is an additional group on our runs, which we call the Support group. These enter after the support fate is completed - more on that later.
We never use `Aetheric Stabilisers` on our runs, as we have assigned portal locations. Using a stabiliser would cause chaos as the portal locations would likely change and people could loose out on the run. As such **Stabilisers are banned** for the main group and only allowed for the Support group.

Before entering the portals, we take a fairy buff for the extra benefits it provides. It is possible to do BA without it, but it makes it a bit safer to have, and faster.

So in short:
1. Kill Ovni (The Fate "I don't want to believe")
2. Obtain portal buff from getting a gold rating
3. Go to a fairy
4. Wait for blue portals to appear
5. Grab the fairy buff
6. Head to your assigned portal location, and enter BA once it turns red

![](img/red-portal.jpg)

Where your portal is, can be found on the portal map. During the run, your Party Lead will tell you which group and number you are so you can find it on the map.

The actual portal map is specific to which discord you are running with, as the groups are organised a little differently:

### Eurekan Academy
![](img/Portal_map_EA.jpg)

### Light Forays Group
![](img/portals-lfg.jpg)


## Inside BA

Once we entered the Arsenal, we pop a `Spirit of the Remembered` and an appropriate wisdom for your role. Then we wait on the bridge until some volunteers who brought `Shell` and `Protect` have handed that out to you. After that you can use the Logos Manipulator to recraft Logos actions so you are well prepared for what's ahead.

Now is also the right time to use the `/magiaauto` command. It will adjust your magia wheel to the offensive (or defensive, if you use the command twice) setting. All roles except tanks want to have this on the offensive setting at all times. For tanks it depends if you are one of the main tanks for the run, or at a boss.

## Art and Owain

The raid will now split into two halves, where one side does the Art boss, and the other does Owain. These two bosses need to be dealt with at the same time, and which side you go to depends on which group you are in.
Your Party leader will tell you where to go, but if unsure - just ask! Once you dropped down the ledge, you cannot go back to the entrance, so make sure you go to the right side.

### Art

Here is a quick sequence of the things Art will do. Listen for the callouts and dodge his AEs.

1. Thricecull - Tank buster
2. Carver/Spinner. Art does one mechanic, then immediately the other
    - Legendspinner - get **IN** (or very far) to avoid the Donut AE
    - Legendcarver - get **OUT** to avoid the AE
3. Acallum na senorach - Raidwide damage
4. Summon Spears
5. Carver/Spinner. Artdoes the mechanic, then spears will do the same mechanic right away (dodge quickly!)
6. Acallum na senorach
8. Thricecull
9. Summon Spears
10. Carver/Spinner, spears do the same
11. Legendary Geass and beyond - we rarely see this anymore. Listen for callouts if we do!

### Owain

Here is a quick sequence of the things Art will do. Listen for the callouts and dodge his AEs. Helps if you are aware of where the fire/ice spears are.

1. Thricecull - Tank buster
2. Acallum na senorach - Raidwide damage
3. Summon Spears
4. Elemental Shift - he will be aligned to fire or ice. watch his hands
5. Elemental Magicks - Dodge to the **opposite** type of spear (i.e. if Owain is Ice, go to a Fire spear)
6. Thricecull - Tank buster
7. Acallum na senorach
8. Elemental Shift
9. Elemental Magicks
10. Thricecull
11. Spiritcull and beyond - we rarely see this anymore. Listen for callouts if we do!

## A note on Traps

We have one or two people on Perception duty (that is a logos action to reveal traps). They will scout ahead to reveal the traps for us, so we can safely avoid them. You never want to go into an area that the trappers have not made safe yet.

Big traps are explosive, and will kill you instantly. The smaller traps apply a nasty DoT that you also want to avoid.

![](img/BA-traps.png)

## Raiden

1. spirits of the fallen - raidwide damage
2. shingan - tankbuster
3. thundercall - outer platform becomes death zone
4. ame-no-sakahoko - go south (C marker) to avoid the **BIG AE**
5. whirling zantetsuken - get **inside his hitbox**
6. ball lightning - stack in the middle to bait AE
7. lateral zantetsuken - dodge either left or right depending where he holds his sword. Listen to the callouts to make this easy
8. lancing bolt - If you marked with this, place your AE around the edge
9. booming lament - puddle AEs, dodge them quickly
10. cloud to ground and beyond - we rarely see this anymore. Listen for callouts if we do!

## The search for the portal and Elemental rooms

### Finding the portal

Next up, there is more trash to clear and traps to find. just follow along and watch for any AEs. In the "no fun hallways", be sure to not use big AEs like dances, earthly stars, etc as this could pull unwanted mobs!

We will do two things:
1. Find a treasure chest in one of the rooms
2. Find a green portal that leads us to a different area of BA

Once we found the portal, there is a bit more trash to clear, then the raid splits into the individual group and each group clears their assigned room.

### Elemental rooms

Below is how Eurekan Academy splits their groups. LFG does it in a similar way, and in both cases your Party Lead will mark the correct room for you.

![](img/elemental-rooms.png)


Once the trap in your room is cleared (most likely by your tank, using invulnerability), and everyone is ready, the tanks switch their stance on, switch to the defensive element for their room (and use a `Wisdom of the Guardian` to help with healing), mobs spawn. We kill those quickly, then move on to AV, where we will wait (about 7 min break) for the Support group to arrive.

### Support Fate

Most runs will have a 7th group, that stays behind after Ovni and do the Support Fate. This will spawn **immediately** after the elemental rooms are activated.

Key info for this fate:
- Dualcast - Tornado II (Donut) then **immediately** Aeroaga IV (AE). Or the other way around. Dodge in/out as appropriate
- Spine Lash - frontal cone AoE.
- Shock Spikes - Use `Dispel L` to remove this buff
- Mighty Strikes - Use `Dispel L` to remove this buff
- Meteor - If you forgot to use dispell then this will wipe you, otherwise it's pretty harmless

Additionally, keep `Feint L` up on the boss to lower it's evasion stat.

After killing this fate, people will get their portal buffs, just like after Ovni. However, this time the 8 portals will be in random places. Just spread out, relax, and communicate with each other which portal you want to take. When the blue portals turn red, they will randomise locations once more, so don't rush to the blue ones just yet, wait for red portals on the map.

Once inside, do a quick craft if you have to, otherwise use the Shortcut to join the main group and fight AV + Ozma together.

## Absolute Virtue (AV)

Recommended to keep `Feint L` up on AV as he's very evasive. Usually the Support Tank brings this action.

1. Meteor - Raidwide damage
2. Eidos - AV will pick either light or dark element to attune himself with
3. Hostile Aspect - Dodge Puddles. They will double in size
4. Medusa Jaelin - cone AE. be close to AV to have an easy time dodging this
5. Eidos
6. Impact Stream - dodge light/dark (opposite colour to AV)
7. Aural Wind - tankbuster
8. Eidos
9. Hostile Aspect - Puddles again, but this time both colours. Watch the pattern and be far from the ones that will expand!
9. Turbulent Aether - if you get a tether, be prepared to take your orb to the opposite coloured puddle
10. Medusa Javelin - dodge the conal AE and **now resolve your orb mechanic**
11. Aural Wind
12. Meteor
13. Meteor
14. Explosive Impulse - Proximity AE - pop `Sprint` and run to the edge
15. Triple Impact stream. Listen to the callouts and don't run too far from the middle
16. Explosive Impulse and beyond - we rarely see this anymore. Just listen for callouts if we do!

## Ozma

Ah, the final boss!

For this we have 3 main platforms, and a ring. And 6 portal buffers in total (blue circles).
Depending on the Discord you run with, the markers and assignments are different, but you will have an assigned spot for the Black Hole mechanic, so watch which one that is. You will also need to pay attention where your two designated Meteor markers are.

Ozma has several distinct phases/shapes
- Cube
    - Donut AE, you want to be close
    - Laser attacks, tanks left, group right
    - Orbs
    - Holy knockback
- Pyramid
    - Line AE, get off the platform
    - Bleed attack - see below
    - Acceleration Bomb - see below
    - Meteor Impact - resolve markers and kill adds
- Star
    - Large AE, be far away
    - Continuous shared stack attacks
    - Shooting Star - knockback from the middle of the platform
    - Meteor Impact

This could be quite a lengthy explanation here, but I want to keep it simple for you so we will focus on the key facts and key mechanics are are likely to give you problems as a first-timer.

1. Black Hole. Between Phases, Ozma will turn into a Sphere, and eject anyone not on a Black Hole Buffer. Be sure not to greed DPS and stand on yours in time to avoid that
2. Acceleration Bomb. If you got one of these, stop casting, emoting, and, well, literally wait for it to expire before doing anything else. If you notice it in time, you can often move to the ring and avoid getting hit with another mechanic. 
3. Meteors. Repeat after me: *To the back and to the right*  Place them on the markers that your Party lead will have mentioned to you. If you're unsure - do ask again. This can wipe the raid if you get it wrong. Placing these right also take priority over the Acceleration Bomb, should be be so unlucky and get both mechanics.


### Acceleration Bomb

### Meteor

</video>

### Bleedbaiting

In Pyramid Phase, one healer per platform will need to stand at the back to bait the bleed AE. They can easily heal themselves and `Esuna` the bleed. It's not very difficult to do, and typically the Expedition Leader will ask for volunteers to handle this part, so feel free to volunteer for it!


### Tank Duties

You may be a MT for your platform, or an OT, which in turn means you are responsible for running into the Orbs in Cube Phase, and tanking the Adds in Star Shape.
A defensive logos action like `Wisdom of the Guardian` is great for that, and be in defensive element on your magia wheel.

The Orbs will hit you through invulnerability, so pop plenty of cooldowns when you take those, and be quick with resolving this mechanic to avoid the Orb AEs clipping the main group on the platform.


## Post-BA

Check your Achievement Log for the mount, you can claim it there. If you do this right after the run, just go to the `Last 5` category and it should be waiting for you right there!


## This was fun - I want to learn more

Hope you enjoyed this quick intro into BA. There is a lot more to it and you can often find special runs that keep the excitement high by using special rules for the run (i.e. only Tanks allowed, or a low number of players to make it more challenging). Even on regular runs, there are many Logos actions which you can use to do more damage, find traps, etc. We are working on some advanced guides for these and video series to explain more of it, so watch this space. This guide will link to the new resources as they become available.

## Magicite and Logos actions upgrades

To get two more magicites, you can farm (or buy) these items:

- Lamebrix’s Dice + Ying-Yang’s Tissue + Skoll’s Claw
- Molech’s Horn + Goldemar’s Horn + Ceto’s Claw

To get more Logos action slots (you can have 6 max), you can speak to the `Expedition Alchemist` and hand over `Aethertight Flask`. That can be obtained by opening a chest from a Hydatos Bunny Fate.
