## What is BA?

The Baldesion Arsenal is the final raid zone inside Hydatos, and has some special rules (i.e. you cannot rez). You will need Elemental Level 60 to enter and have the main Eureka questline completed.

//Explain how to confirm that you are done with all the quests, but resolving quest line is out of scope

## How do I join?

For all runs, we are using Discord for voice chat (you don't have to speak, but at least be able to listen). On the Light datacentre, please join 
- [Eurekan Academy](https://discord.gg/eurekanacademy) 
- [Light Forays Group](https://discord.gg/LightForays)

and take a look at the `#assign-role` / `#role-selection` channels so you are able to join us in voice.

A typical run takes about 2 hours. Not all the time is spent fighting, but if we have new players joining, we spend time on explanations too. And sometimes, Ovni spawn can delay the actual start too - more on that later.

## How do I prepare?

You will need Logograms.
It is important that everone has a Spirit of the remembered, and basic dps logograms for their role.

Below are the recommended actions for players who are new to BA. There are more advanced actions you could use, but we'll get to that at the end of this guide, and it is fine if you stick to the basic actions for now.

### Umbral/Astral slots

You will need to know how to craft in both Umbral/Astral slots to make best use of your Logos action slots. Here is how:

## What do we do before we go into BA?

Explain Ovni, fairy, blue/red portals

The portal map is a bit different depending on which discord you are running with, as the groups are numbered a bit differently:

### Eurekan Academy

### Light Forays Group

## Inside BA

//Briefly explain what's at the entrance and how we split up

//`/magiaauto`

## Art/Owain

//explain the basics (elements and carver/spinner)

## On the note of Traps

Let's not blow ourselves up, and here is how:

We have one or two people on Perception duty (that is a logos action to reveal traps). They will scout ahead to reveal the traps for us, so we can safely avoid them. You never want to go into an area that the trappers have not made safe yet.

## Raiden

//Basic mechanics up to exaflares

## The search for the portal and Elemental rooms
