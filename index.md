## What is BA?

The Baldesion Arsenal is the final raid zone inside Hydatos, and has some special rules (i.e. you cannot rez). You will need Elemental Level 60 to enter and have the main Eureka questline completed.

This guide is intended for players who are new to BA, so it will not aim to explain *everything*. Things like chaining Double Edge, reflecting the Earth room or even how to use Death L are beyond the scope of this page. Buf if you want to learn more, and enjoyed your first run, do check out the links towards the end, and the two discords have a ton of advanced resources too to help you continue to learn and become a BA veteran.

The quickest way to check if you are ready to join BA, is if you see no blue lines going towards the building at the horizon, and if the `Expedition Scholar` at (21.1, 13.8) in Hydatos is willing to sell you an `Aetheric Stabilizer` (DON'T buy one, this is just to test).
If this is not the case then you will need to check where you are with your quests and complete them.

### Hydatos questline

- Level 50: Talk to Krile and then, after a cutscene, to Gerolt. After another cutscene, speak again with Krile.
- Level 51: Talk to Krile. Head to The Central Columns at 20.3-24.8 and talk again to Krile. Head south to The Val River Source 25.7-30.7 to find the Pooled Aether. Return to the The Central Columns and speak to Krile.
- Level 54: Talk to Krile. Head to The Western Columns at 10.6-29.6 and talk to Krile again. Head to The West Val River Bank 6.5-15.7 to find the Pooled Aether after walking up the large column. Return to The Western Columns at 10.6-29.6 and talk to Krile.
- Level 57: Talk to Krile at the The Western Columns at 10.6-29.6. Then head east to The Eastern Columns at 31.3-27.2 and talk to Krile again. Head north to The East Val River Bank at 30.8-14.4 to find the Pooled Aether. Return to The Eastern Columns at 31.3-27.2 and talk to Krile.
- Level 60: Talk to Krile at the The Eastern Columns at 31.3-27.2. Head to The Aetherbridge Foundation at 24.0-30.6 and talk again to Krile. Head into the Headquarters Entrance and talk to Krile, then talk to her again in the Board Room. Interact with the Scattered Tomes and talk again to Krile for a few lengthy cutscenes. Choose between Krile's path (sealing) or that of Ejika Tsunjika (destruction) for another cutscene. Return to Central Point and talk to Ejika Tsunjika (when doing Krile's path) or Krile (when doing Ejika's path) to complete the quest.

## How do I join?

For all runs, we are using Discord for voice chat (you don't have to speak, but at least be able to listen). On the Light datacentre, please join 
- [Eurekan Academy](https://discord.gg/eurekanacademy) 
- [Light Forays Group](https://discord.gg/LightForays)

and take a look at the `#assign-role` / `#role-selection` channels so you are able to join us in voice.

A typical run takes about 2 hours. Not all the time is spent fighting, but if we have new players joining, we spend time on explanations too. And sometimes, Ovni spawn can delay the actual start too - more on that later.

There are several types of BA runs
- Impromptu Runs: These are without sign-up in advance. The code to enter the Party Finder groups will be posted shortly before the run, and all spots are FFA and they're newbie-friendly
- Frag Runs: Similar to an Impromptu, but they typically stop before AV and don't go all the way to the end of BA. Good for getting those fragments as they're pretty quick!
- Organised Runs (Newbie/Reclear): These are with signups in advanced and have a fixed roster. Sometimes there are free spots for late joiners, but usually they are filled well in advance
- Challenge runs / Meme runs / Reflex runs / Mechanic runs / Squad runs: Special rules apply on these. Maybe better left for when you are more experienced, as a lot of these are without explanations

## How do I prepare?

You will need Logograms.
It is important that everone has a Spirit of the remembered, and basic dps logograms for their role.

Below are the recommended actions for players who are new to BA. There are more advanced actions you could use, but we'll get to that at the end of this guide, and it is fine if you stick to the basic actions for now.

### Umbral/Astral slots

You will need to know how to craft in both Umbral/Astral slots to make best use of your Logos action slots. Here is how:

### Tanks

## What do we do before we go into BA?

To enter the Arsenal, you need a special buff that is available from either the Ovni fate, or Tristitia. It will allow you to enter the portals. To get the buff, you need to have BA unlocked, and be level 60, and get a gold rating from the fate.
So it is important that you do get a hit in and do some damage to it, otherwise you may not be able to enter BA at all.

For most players in the raid, we enter after the Ovni fate. There often is an additional group on our runs, which we call the Support group. These enter after the support fate is completed - more on that later.
We never use `Aetheric Stabilisers` on our rund, as we have assigned portal locations. Using a stabiliser would cause chaos as the portal locations would likely change and people could loose out on the run. As such **Stabilisers are banned** for the main group and only allowed for the Support group.

Before entering the portals, we take a fairy buff for the extra benefits it provides. It is possible to do BA without it, but it makes it a bit safer to have, and faster.

So in short:
1. Kill Ovni (The Fate "I don't want to believe")
2. Obtain portal buff from getting a gold rating
3. Go to a fairy
4. Wait for blue portals to appear
5. Grab the fairy buff
6. Head to your assigned portal location, and enter BA once it turns red

Where your portal is, can be found on the portal map. During the run, your Party Lead will tell you which group and number you are so you can find it on the map.

The actual portal map is specific to which discord you are running with, as the groups are organised a little differently:

### Eurekan Academy

## Inside BA

//Briefly explain what's at the entrance and how we split up

//`/magiaauto`

## Art/Owain

//explain the basics (elements and carver/spinner)

## On the note of Traps

Let's not blow ourselves up, and here is how:

We have one or two people on Perception duty (that is a logos action to reveal traps). They will scout ahead to reveal the traps for us, so we can safely avoid them. You never want to go into an area that the trappers have not made safe yet.

## Raiden

## The search for the portal and Elemental rooms
